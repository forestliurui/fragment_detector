hadoop jar SN.jar SNOMEDCTDriver input_arg0_directory input_arg1_directory output_directory

where arg0 is file which contains all node ids (each per row) in the graph;

arg1 is the file whose row is like:
a[TAB]b,c,d...
where b,c,d... is only the direct parents of a;

output is the file whose row is like:
a[TAB]b
where b is among the upper closure of a, i.e. b is one of a's (direct or indirect) parent;

After getting the results, please use the included clos2frag.py to convert the output file into the format that can be used for fragment computation.
